delete from tail (pop)
# To Delete The curr Tail , just make the tail.next = None, this means Lsdt second Element WIll be New Tail
        """curr != none  ---> Curr Stops At None , and After Loop Completion Curr = none
           curr.next != None  --->  Curr stops At Tail , curr = Tail
           curr.next.next != None  ---> curr Stops At Last second Element , Curr = Last second Node
